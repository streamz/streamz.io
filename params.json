It is designed to process streaming event sources (such as feeds, server logs etc...) on a multi-tenant compute cluster. The programming paradigm is similar to map-reduce, scatter/gather and CEP (complex event processing). streamz is simple. No configuration files, just a script or a few lines of code and streamz is processing \"big data\" at scale.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
